      <br/>
      Use the <span class="o_status d-inline-block bg-warning"></span> state to indicate a request for changes or a need for discussion on a task.
      <br/><br/>
      Use the <span class="fa fa-check-circle text-success d-inline-block"></span> state to mark the task as complete.
      <br/>
      Use the <span class="fa fa-times-circle text-danger d-inline-block"></span> state to mark the task as cancelled.
      <br/><br/>
      Look for the <span class="fa fa-hourglass-o d-inline-block"></span> icon to see tasks waiting on other ones. Once a task is marked as complete or cancelled, all of its dependencies will be unblocked.
